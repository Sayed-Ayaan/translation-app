# Overview
This is a simple app that translates speech in real time and sends the translated audio back to the user in their chosen language.
It uses Metaâ€™s Seamless M4T model for language translation, and WebSocket for maintaining a live connection between the client and server.
The goal is to make live conversations smoother across languages by providing both speech to speech translation and speech to text translation.
